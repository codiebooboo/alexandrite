# alexandritelang
A Basic Small Experiment Where I Gave ChatGPT A Generated Document Of "Alexandrite" Which Is Generated From GPT4 And Told It To Generate The Code For Making A Basic Programming Language From It. You May Fork This Repository. As For The Files In The Others Folder, It Is Another Test. Multiple Tests May Be Added Soon.

Disclaimer: It Doesn't Really Work.
